Here ya go. In this state the dump isn't really usable for insertion, but that's not really the aim here.
If you want to tweak things further, here's how:

0: Biraku Emblem used a headered 1.1 FE3 rom, and therefore this dump expects the same.
1: Grab Cartographer, the dumping program, from RHDN (or one of my other repros, odds are I was sloppy and left the .exe in there.)
2: Open "menusJP.tbl" and add any additional kanji you've identified.
3: Run "_FE3.bat" to dump the text.

Barring what I identified in Biraku and BSFE, most of the kanji just prints as <$XX><$00> (or <$01>). Properly filling this in would be nice.

I haven't touched the dialogue yet. I'll get around to it at some point, probably to hunt for that one Midia quote on Serenes.
There's also a bunch of table drawing characters to represent boxes being drawn as such. Feel free to edit them out.
